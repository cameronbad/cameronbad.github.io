                    <p>A webapp I worked on as a collaborative project in a group of 4 during my final year of university. The brief given for this project was to "design, develop and 
                        test a multiple-choice testing platform", I acted as the group leader and was involved in the development of the student dashboard and the test functionality.
                        The webapp is no longer hosted online due to having used university databases and servers, but the entire project was coded in GitHub and the repository is
                        publically available.

                    <p>A C# project I created as part of my university course, it works entirely through the console window. The main functionality of this project
                        is the ability to translate text into morse code and vice versa. It also had functionality for creating encoded morse code messages, alogn with a 
                        training function where you were shown a morse character and had to input the corresponding alphabetical character. The repository for this project is
                        hosted publically on GitHub.

                    <p>WordPress website/theme I made as part of my final year web development project, designed as a "off the shelf" website solution for clients who 
                        want to book and market holiday homes. The theme comes with a number of page templates and a custom admin dashboard. The theme was not able to perfectly
                        integrate all the plugins used due to my inexperience but the website itself ran well. The website is no longer available but the theme can be downloaded
                        as a zip below.

                        getting a clear plan of what I wanted to build.
